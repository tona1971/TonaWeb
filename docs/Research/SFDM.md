# Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM)

The Scalar Field Dark Matter model has been known in various ways throughout its history; Fuzzy, BEC, Wave, Ultralight, Axion-like Dark Matter, etc. All of them consist in proposing that dark matter of the universe is a spinless field Φ that follows the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation of motion □Φ − _dV_/_dΦ = 0, for a given scalar field potential V_. The difference between different models is sometimes the choice of the scalar field potential _V_. In the literature we find that people usually work in the non-relativistic, weak-field limit of the Klein-Gordon equation, where it transforms into the Schrödinger equation and the Einstein equations into the Poisson equation, reducing the KG-Einstein system, to the Schrödinger-Poisson system. Here we review some of the most interesting achievements of this model from the historical point of view and its comparison with observations, showing that this model could be the last answer to the question about the nature of dark matter in the universe.

In 1998, it was proposed in ([Matos and Guzman, 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B89)) that SF can solve the problem of dark matter and that this field can explain the rotation curves of galaxies, initiating the first systematic study of this paradigm. Subsequently, the idea of SFDM has been rediscovered many times, such as Fuzzy DM ([Hu et al., 2000](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B62)), Quintessential DM ([Arb et al., 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B9); [Arbey et al., 2002](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B10)); Ultralight DM ([Amendola and Barbieri, 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B7); [Lundgren et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B86)); Bose-Einstein condensate DM ([Boehmer and Harko, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B22); [Rindler-Daller and Shapiro, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B116); [Chavanis, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B32)); Wave DM (([Bray, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B26); [Schive et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B122))); Super Fluid DM ([Berezhiani et al., 2023a](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B19)), etc. In 2017 this idea became fashionable and one of the favorite candidates to explain DM after the publication of the article ([Hui et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2024.1347518/full#B64)).

The SFDM model has two parameters, the mass m=̂mc/ℏ, where ̂m is the mass in grams, and the self-interaction parameter _λ_. With these two parameters, it is possible to fit a large number of DM observations into the universe. The objective of this work is to historically list some of its most important achievements, and we will focus on the following.

• Good agreement of the rotation curves of stars and dust around galaxies.

• Good agreement with cosmological constrains and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

• An alternative solution to the cusp-core problem.

• An alternative solution to the problem of satellites.

• The central black holes in galaxies.

• This is in excellent agreement with the CMB and MPS cosmological observations.

• The agreement with the cosmological numerical simulation.

• A natural explanation of the anomalous trajectories of satellites around galaxies.

Some predictions.

• The existence of a soliton at the center of galaxies.

• The structure formation of galaxies according to cosmological numerical simulations

• An alternative explanation to the Fermi Bubbles
