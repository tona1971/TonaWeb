He completed his undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics and subsequently his master's degree in physics at the Escuela Superior de Física y Matemáticas of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). He obtained his doctorate in Theoretical Physics in 1987 from Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany, and his habilitation in Astrophysics in 1998 from the same university.

He completed postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology. He has conducted research at the Albert Einstein Institute of the Max Planck Foundation in Germany and at German and American universities. He has been a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

He was Founding Vice President of the División de Gravitación y Física Matemática of the Sociedad Mexicana de Física (SMF) in 1992 and subsequently President in 1995.
He has also been a founder and co-organizer of the Escuela Mexicana de Astrofísica (EMA) since 1998 and Founding Secretary General of the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmología (IAC) from 2007 to 2015. 
He served as President of the SMF from 2019 to 2021.

He has published over 250 articles, 150 of which are in indexed journals of Mathematical and Theoretical Physics, with over 4,700 citations. Several of these have been included in the Featured Articles list of the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity or have been cited extensively. Six are book chapters, over 50 are conference proceedings, and more than a dozen appear in popular science journals. 

He published:
The popular science books: ¿De qué está hecho el Universo? and, in 2025, Agujeros de Gusano y Propulsión por Curvatura, co-authored with Miguel Alcubierre, both from the "La ciencia para todos" series of the Fondo de Cultura Económica (Economic Culture Fund);

the novel El Tesoro de Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin with Editorial Colofón;

the popular science book Radiación Cósmica de Fondo del Universo with Editorial Colofón;

the monograph Principios Matemáticos para Ciencias Exactas with Editorial IAC, also published by Colofón;

and the videos: ¿De qué está hecho el Universo?, with over 10,000 views,

and The Scientific Version of Genesis, with over 5,500 views, both on YouTube. 

He has edited seven specialized books and participated in the organization of 46 conferences on gravitation, cosmology, and astrophysics in Mexico and abroad.

He has graduated 22 doctoral students, two of whom received the Arturo Rosenblueth Prize from Cinvestav and another the Weizmann Prize from the Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (AMC), both for best doctoral dissertation. In addition, two of them have been awarded the Marcos Moshinsky Chair at the Instituto de Física of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).

He has also supervised 42 master's theses and 10 undergraduate theses, several of which have also received awards.

These students, in turn, have supervised numerous undergraduate and master's theses, and more than 40 doctoral dissertations; two of these also received the Weizmann Prize.

Currently, virtually all of his graduates are members of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI), four of them at Level III.
He has supervised 20 postdoctoral researchers. He has participated as a speaker at more than 150 conferences and has been invited as a speaker to more than 60 international conferences.

He has founded three research groups. In 2001, together with Miguel Alcubierre and Darío Núñez of the ICN (Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares), he founded the Astrophysical Supercomputing Laboratory (LaSumA) at Cinvestav (Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados), a cluster of 64 processors for high-level work in numerical relativity, the first of its kind in Latin America.

He has taught dozens of undergraduate, master's, and doctoral courses at Mexican, German, Austrian, and Canadian universities.

He has been a member of the SMF since 1982, the AMC since 1992, the SNI (Level III) since 2003, Sigma Xi, Scientific Research Society since 2004, the New York Academy of Sciences since 2007 (by invitation), and the American Physical Society since 2013. 

He was awarded the Scientific Research Prize of the Mexican Physics Society in 2007 and the Marcos Moshinsky Medal from the Instituto de Física of the UNAM in 2022. 

He has served on:
the AMC Admissions Committee (2006-2010),
the Evaluation Committee of the Instituto de Matemáticas of UNAM (2008-2014),
the PRIDE Committee of the Instituto de Astronomia of UNAM (2010-2014),
the Evaluation Committee of the SNI 2010-2012 (elected),
the PRIDE Special Committee for the area of ​​Physics and Mathematics 2014-2016 (awarded by the Rector of UNAM),
the AMC Awards Committee 2014-2016 (elected),
the SNI Appeals Committee 2015, of the CONACYT 
Research Chair Evaluation Committee 2017 and 2020,
of the Marcos Moshinsky Research Chair Awards Committee 2021,
of the Evaluation Committee of the Institute of Nuclear Sciences at UNAM 2017-2022.

His work now focuses on discovering the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which represent more than 96% of the matter in the universe. In 1998, he proposed that dark matter could be a spinless particle with an ultralight mass, and initiated the first systematic study of this paradigm in the world. This model is now one of the most popular and favored models for the nature of dark matter, which makes up 25% of the matter in the universe. See, for example, “On the hypothesis that cosmological dark matter is composed of ultra-light bosons,” by Lam Hui, Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Scott Tremaine, and Edward Witten, Physical Review D95, 043541 (2017). arXiv:1610.08297.
